## How it works
### 1. System Level: Gm-C Filter Architecture
Ultimately, the circuits implemented in this document serve as the foundational building blocks for a complete, continuous-time **Gm-C (Transconductor-Capacitor) Filter**. 

The Unity-Gain Miller OTA detailed below represents the first fully completed OTA block of this overarching system. A second OTA, which is required to finalize the filter topology, is currently in the active building stage. 

A central design strategy of this project is **shared biasing**. Once the second OTA is integrated, it will be driven by the exact same **Beta-Multiplier Reference (BMR)** developed here. Sharing a single, autonomous biasing network across multiple OTAs ensures matched transconductance ($g_m$) behavior, guarantees consistent performance across the chip, and drastically minimizes both total power consumption and silicon footprint on the TinyTapeout frame.

### 2. Unity-Gain Configuration & Core Performance
At its core, the Two-Stage Miller OTA provides a  **open-loop gain of over 60 dB**. To create the buffer configuration, the inverting input is directly hardwired to the output ($V_{out}$) in a strict negative feedback loop. This transforms the internal differential amplifier into a **single-input, single-output** voltage follower, carefully optimized across multiple performance axes:

*   **Precision Tracking:** The > 60 dB open-loop gain minimizes steady-state error, ensuring the closed-loop voltage gain is extremely close to unity ($A_v \approx 1$). The output accurately tracks the non-inverting input.
*   **Transient & Slew Performance:** The circuit is designed for fast large-signal response, achieving a strong simulated **Slew Rate of 18.65 V/µs**. This ensures rapid and accurate settling during sharp input transitions or pulse signals.
*   **Robust Load Drive & Stability:** The transconductance ($g_m$) of the second stage and the lead-compensation network are meticulously sized to stably drive a **3 pF capacitive load**. Under these load conditions, the buffer maintains a highly stable **Phase Margin of > 65 degrees**, completely preventing unwanted oscillations or ringing.
*   **Strategic Power Distribution:** The total power consumption is tightly controlled at **162.72 µW**. To achieve the high slew rate and drive the capacitive load effectively, the majority of the power is strategically allocated to the second stage (**127 µW**), while the differential pair (**7.72 µW**) and BMR (**28 µW**) operate with strict power efficiency.

### 3. Miller Compensation with Lead Resistor
Driving a 3 pF capacitive load in a unity-gain configuration represents the absolute worst-case scenario for amplifier stability. To achieve robust stability, we rely on a **Miller compensation network**, specifically enhanced with a **lead compensation** technique:

*   **Lead Compensation Strategy:** To neutralize this RHP zero while maintaining the crucial Miller pole-splitting effect, we added a "nulling resistor" in series with the Miller capacitor. This lead compensation breaks the high-frequency feedforward path. By carefully sizing this resistance, we force the RHP zero to infinity or move it into the Left-Half-Plane (LHP). This restores a healthy phase margin, ensuring the buffer remains completely stable without sustained ringing.
*   **Active MOS Resistor for Area & PVT Robustness:** In integrated circuit layout, large passive resistors consume a massive amount of valuable silicon real estate. Given the strict area boundaries of a TinyTapeout tile, using a traditional passive resistor for lead compensation was highly inefficient. Instead, we implemented this series resistance using an **active MOS transistor biased deep in the linear (triode) region**. Beyond drastically reducing the layout footprint, this active approach provides a crucial advantage for **PVT (Process, Voltage, and Temperature)** stability. The resistance of a passive poly-resistor varies completely independently of the amplifier's transconductance ($g_m$). In contrast, an active MOS resistor naturally tracks the $g_m$ shifts of the second-stage transistors across different temperature and process corners. This correlated tracking ensures that the RHP zero cancellation remains perfectly tuned and the phase margin stays stable under all operating conditions.

### 4.Beta-Multiplier Reference & Startup
The system is designed to be completely self-sufficient. It operates entirely without the need for any external current sources or off-chip biasing networks:

*   **Beta-Multiplier Reference (BMR):** The BMR functions as an autonomous, self-biasing current generator. It produces a highly stable internal reference current ($I_{ref}$), which ensures the OTA's transconductance ($g_m$) remains perfectly constant even in the presence of supply voltage ($V_{DD}$) fluctuations. Furthermore, this internal biasing architecture is highly efficient, operating with an ultra-low power consumption of approximately **28 µW**.
*   **Startup Circuit:** Because self-biased networks like the BMR inherently have two stable operating states (the desired active state and a degenerate "zero-current" state), a startup circuit is strictly necessary. This mechanism guarantees that upon power-up, the circuit is immediately forced out of the zero-current state and reliably driven to its target  operating point as the 1.8V power rail stabilizes.

The entire system is optimized for the **TinyTapeout** platform, focusing on stable analog performance and layout efficiency within the 1.8V domain.

## How to test

To verify the buffer's performance and stability:

*   **Load Setup:** Ensure a **3 pF capacitive load** is connected to the output pin (accounting for any parasitic capacitance from probes or traces).
*   **Pulse & Transient Test:** 
    *   Apply a pulse signal at the inpu1 pin (`ua[0]`) with an amplitude ranging from **0.4V to 1.0V**.
    *   Run a **1 µs transient test** to observe the slewing and settling behavior. 
    *   Verify that the output accurately follows the input without sustained ringing, confirming the 60+ dB precision and the stability of the compensation network under load.
*   **Power-Up Test:** Ramp the $V_{DD}$ from 0V to 1.8V to confirm the **Startup Circuit** successfully initializes the BMR.
